# ARCHIVED
This package is no longer supported as of January 5th, 2019, and for good reason:
* Google Plus, which this package relies upon, will shut down this year
* `auth_oauth2` already exists and works very well

It is recommended to use `package:angel_auth_oauth2` instead:
https://github.com/angel-dart/auth_oauth2
